  <h1>Hello World!</h1>

  <ul>
   <li><a href="http://www.therockwfk.com/2014/08/washington-rocks/">The Rock</a></li>I like this because I love their pizza and the theme of the resturaunt. The resturaunt has menu items inspired by famous bands and has the same bands albums all over the walls.
    <li><a href="https://www.behance.net">Behance</a></li> I like behance because it shows other designers projects and ideas that they have created. This site has just about anything you can imagine when it comes to designs/projects.
    <li><a href="http://2014.artsy.net">2014 Artsy</a></li>Instead of the typical scrolling down, its more on a horizontal scroll. The pages fade as you scroll through the previous page. I thought it was and interesting way to get you to discover the page.
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>My third page. How would someone create that type of scrolling? Is that through javascript? </li>
    <li>The Rock. How would someone create that type of transition from various menu items? </li>
    </ol>

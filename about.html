   <p>Hannah Ronhovde, 22, Senior, VCD art minor. I have always had a creative mind as I have always drawn things and done photography, once I realized the settings on the camera.<em>I grew up in a artistic household.</em> My mom is a music teacher and my brother and I have taken years of piano. My grandfather was a photographer for the Norwegian airforce and his brother was the pen and graphite artist. Since I know that studio art is known to be very difficult to make a living in, I chose the next best thing.And as I mentioned before, being creative/ artistic is kind of a family thing that has fortunately been passed down through generations.</p>
